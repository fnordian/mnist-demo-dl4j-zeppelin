Downloading the MNIST dataset
=============================

MNIST is a database of handwritten digits and matching labels. 
Consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples it is a classic machine learning problem, 
well suited to introduce image recognition algorithms to beginners.

A detailed description of the data and download-links can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

This project loads the gzipped datafiles directly from there.
